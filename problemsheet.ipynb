    "# ETH Hackathon with Quantinuum: May 3 -- 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the ETH Hackathon!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we will start from the basics and slowly build up a set of advanced tools and strategies for designing quantum circuits.\n",
    "In the process, the goal is that we will also build up an intuition of what quantum computations is about, how quantum compilation works and where their computational\n",
    "power is coming from!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In this task you will learn about a circuit \"normal form\" and implement all the necessary\n",
    "circuit transformations to convert a circuit into this normal form.\n",
    "This normal form is of great interest for many reasons:\n",
    " - it gives a great intuition and mental model of what quantum computations are capable of: arbitrary circuits are decomposed into blocks, each with a very clear interpretation.\n",
    " - it is a quantum compiler enginneer's dream: on top of forming the basis of one of the most well-known optimisation strategies for error corrected circuits [1], very recent work has shown that this form is amenable reinforcement learning-based optimistion, with great results [2]! It also decomposes the compilation problem into a series of smaller problems that have yielded entire research avenues, from the optimisation of diagonal gates to Hadamard gate optimisation and the simplification of classical reversible circuits.\n",
    " - it uses a wide variety of gate types as well as slightly \"advanced\" quantum computation techniques such as classically controlled gates -- in summary, a great learning opportunity :D\n",
    "\n",
    "### pyTKET\n",
    "\n",
    "All code example and tasks will be expressed using [pytket](https://tket.quantinuum.com/api-docs/), a Python library for quantum circuit manipulation and compilation.\n",
    "We will showcase some of its features and will be at your disposal for the entire duration of the hackathon in case of questions, feature requests, etc. Feedback is much appreciated, and there is a decent chance that whatever you request will be implemented in pytket (pure coincidence, of course)!\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you use pytket for this task, but you are free to use whatever tool you like. If you feel more comfortable with qiskit or another framework feel free to use that and compare the results -- we cannot guarantee that you will be able to solve all the tasks as easily with it, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you new to `pytket` and quantum computing? We recommend you start with TODO: link this pytket beginner's guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We are providing notebook cloud environments for you to work in. The python environments will have `pytket`, `qiskit` and many other popular python libraries already installed and ready to use. You will even get free access to our remote quantum simulator, which you can use to run your circuits with accurate(-ish) noise simulation."

    "## Gatesets and their computational power\n",
    "\n",
    "A first consideration when designing quantum circuits is the gateset in which the computation is expressed.\n",
    "If we restrict ourselves to a very small subset of possible gate types, we will inevitably limit our expression power!\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you an idea, consider the following two gate sets:\n",
    " - Only single-qubit gates: if all gates only apply to a single qubit, then no amount of quantum entanglement will be created: in physical terms, it is as if our atoms were space-like separated, decomposing the $2^n$-dimensional state space (for $n$ qubits) into a tensor product of $n$ 2-dimensional spaces. The result is a very small state space that can easily be simulated classically -- no quantum advantage here!\n",
    " - Only \"classical reversible gates\": choosing the gate set X (NOT gate) + CX (controlled-NOT gate) + CCX (controlled-controlled-NOT, or Toffoli, gate), we now obtain a set of operations that may span multiple qubits, and so entanglement will be created. However, as seen as unitary operations, all these gates are made of binary 0-1 matrix elements, and thus do not make use of the quantum property of \"phase\". The result is that these operations correspond exactly to classical arithmetic circuits! (you will see, we always use \"classical\" to refer to what normal computers can do).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases above, we can introduce a \"quantum resource\", i.e. an additional gate type that suddenly increases the computational power of the circuits defined with it:\n",
    "  - in the first case, we can add the CX gate, an entangling operation,\n",
    "  - in the second case, we can add the H gate, a Hadamard gate, which is a single-qubit operation that splits a qubit in the computational `|0>` state into a superposition of two states `|0> + |1>`.\n",
    "The result is \"universal\" quantum computation: i.e. it can be shown that those expanded gate sets are sufficient to express any unitary computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the two cases, what we considered the \"quantum\" resource was a matter of perspective: in one case, we considered the interaction of more than one qubit as the source of quantumness, whereas in the other case that same operation was viewed as a classical operation, that must be extended using \"superposition\" as a resource.\n",
    "In each case, all computations _without_ the key quantum resource become classical, i.e. straightforward to simulate on normal CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clifford circuits\n",
    "Another such split of computational power into \"cheap and classical\" + \"quantum secret sauce\" is the Clifford+T gate set.\n",
    "This is particularly interesting in the context of using error correcting codes to protect quantum computations against noise: it turns out that\n",
    "in popular codes, Cliffords can be performed cheaply whereas T-gates require dedicated state preparation factories on hardware, so called \"magic states\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite surprising at first that Clifford circuits are easy to simulate (a result known as the Gottesman-Knill theorem), as they include _both_\n",
    "entanling and superposition primitives -- the confirmation that what is \"quantumness\" is subjective!\n",
    "The gate set is the following:\n",
    " - the Hadamard gate (\"superposition primitive\")\n",
    " - the CX gate (\"entanglement primitive\")\n",
    " - the S gate (\"pi/4 phase shift primitive\")\n",
    "In this case, the quantumness comes from introducing smaller phase shifts (you can view the Clifford circuits a discretised subset of possible quantum operations). It turns out that up to approximation (the gate set is \"approximately universal\"), it is sufficient to add the T gate to the mix, a pi/8 phase shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTKET comes with a couple of optimisation passes that can be used to simplify Clifford circuits, such as `CliffordPushThroughMeasures` and `CliffordSimp`.\n",

    "with the slight caveat that the operation must be reversible, i.e. invertible!\n",
    "We thus cannot compute boolean AND (it only has one output for two inputs, so cannot be reversible),\n",

    "The restriction to \"reversible\" operations comes directly from the physics: quantum computers manipulate atoms\n",
    "following the laws of quantum mechanics, all of which are reversible -- the result is an overall computation\n",
    "that must it too be reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this reversibility restriction is not a problem: if necessary we can always add additional (qu)bits\n",

    "And AND gate can for then be implemented by the operation (x, y, z) -> (x, y, z + x & y). If the input z is set to 0, then the output will be x & y. This gate is known as the controlled-controlled NOT, aka CCX.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pyTKET, reversible classical operations are described using the `ToffoliBox`. Note that in the literature, the word \"Toffoli\" can confusingly be used to either refer to any reversible classical circuit or to refer specifically to the CCX gate."

    "They are thus not part of the inputs and outputs of this computation.\n",
    "The notation might be a bit unfamiliar, but every block in this circuit is something that we have just gone through:\n",
    " - \"non-Clifford phase gate\" is what we have called a Diagonal gate\n",
    " - \"CNOT circuit\" is a circuit made of CX gates only -- this is a special case of classical reversible circuits\n",

    "First of all, it makes a very non-trivial statement: as cliffords and classical reversible circuits are easy, the only \"classically hard\" part in this form\n",
    "is the diagonal gate on the computational states. Recall that this is a computation of the form\n",

    "In other words, it \"just\" inserts a phase on the computational basis states depending on the values of the ancilla qubits.\n",
    "The CX circuit can be viewed as a sequence of sums of qubits modulo 2, i.e. of the type\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{b_1\\cdots b_n} \\mapsto \\ket{b_1\\cdots b_{i-1} (b_i \\oplus b_k) b_{i+1}\\cdots b_n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for some $k \\neq i$, something that we are familiar from boolean logic and arithmetic circuits.\n",
    "Finally, the last Clifford blocks are a way to choose a \"measurement basis\".\n",
    "In the simplest case, all ancilla qubits measure to 0, in which case the measurement is in the\n",
    "computational basis.\n",
    "In the other case, some classically simple clifford transformations are required before being\n",
    "able to measure the state in the computational basis.\n",
